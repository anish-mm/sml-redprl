   * (1) All judgments should still be closed under any substitution! In
   *     particular, the property that a type A has kind K is closed under any
   *     substitution.
   * (2) If two types are related with respect to a stronger kind (like KAN),
   *     then they are related with respect to a weaker kind (like STABLE).
   *     A stronger kind might demand more things to be equal. For example,
   *     the equality between two types with respect to KAN means that they
   *     are equally Kan, while the equality with respect to STABLE only says
   *     they are equal pretypes.
   * (3) The PER associated with A should *never* depend on its kind. Kinds
   *     should be properties of (the PER of) A.
   * (4) We say KAN = meet (HCOM, COE) because if two types are equally "HCOM"
   *     and equally "COE" then they are equally Kan. Always remember to check
   *     the binary cases.
